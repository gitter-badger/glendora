just joking. it was fun, especially to meet the people there. the ""tutors"" were experienced and able to help. i really liked the shell tool that was created for the event. i would totally come to the next nodeschool!","i personally would change the procedure a little. 

after the start and installation everybody should start with the tasks (like it was) but after maybe 4 tasks you could stop, and solve the problems on the projector and explain it. so everyone can see how to do it and where the problems have been. when its done, push the solutions to the repository and let the people do the next 4 tasks. after maybe 30-40 show them to solve them again and so on.

not sure, but i think that might be helpful when some persons really don't know what to do. on the other hand.. the tasks weren't that hard. they just require to have some experience with js ^^",Yes,,Yes
