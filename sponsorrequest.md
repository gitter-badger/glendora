Dear [company] team,

I am currently organizing a Node.js beginners event on September 15.
With 20 Node mentors, we are going to help about 80 attendees to
learn programming with Node through a set of [self-paced](nodeschool.io)
challenges. It's a nice proven concept and has already been held in
several cities around the world.

We are still looking for sponsors to cover some of the costs. For 
200€ you could sponsor drinks for all the attendees and also for 
200€ sponsor stickers, which are intended to be badges for accomplished
challenges. 

We will promote your logo on the [event page](http://nodeschool.io/berlin/) and the [ticket page](https://ti.to/nodeschool-berlin/jsfest-2014)
as well as during the event. We are also happy if some of you employees
help out as mentors or even join as learners.

Best,
[me]
